Matchismo
=========

A card matching iOS app from the Stanford iOS 7 course on iTunes.  

#### Notes
In multiple match mode, every card is compared to each other recursively, not just self to an array of other cards.

#### Tweaks
* Change scoring system for multiple card matches. Currently, every match gives the same points.  
  e.g. In match-3, 2 matching cards should be worth less than 3 matching cards.
* Put in 30 cards instead of 12.
